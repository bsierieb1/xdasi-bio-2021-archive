    - We will post readings from this book as PDFs for selected topics.

+ [**StatQuest**](https://statquest.org/video-index/)
    - This is a nice series of video tutorials on various topics in statistics and data analysis for molecular geneticists, from the Genetics Department at UNC Chapel Hill. We haven't vetted all of them, but the ones we have seen seem pretty good.
