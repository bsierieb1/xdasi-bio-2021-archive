## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Marcel and Avrami}
### Marcel and Avrami

## Poisson is a discrete distribution, and our events are discrete, either blue or white (0 or 1)

## Question we want to answer: Knowing the average number of blue cells per plate, what is the PMF of blue cells per plate given the range of 0:100. Cells that are blue have been succesfully transformed.

## We need the following parameters: lamba, which is a rate of events/time or events/space. We chose events/space because blue white screening works better with space, meaning you either have blue or white cells on the plate. 

## We chose our rate to be 40 blue cells/plate because based on our lab experience, that is usually how many blue cells we've gotten.

## f. One other distribution that relates for Poisson is exponential, as it can also account for series of events that account for space & time. Exponential can be used for approximations or survival relationships.

## We didn't do ggplot because we're not publishing this, and it doesn't need to be pretty, but we still tried to make it look nice with the plot function

# lamba
blue.cells.per.plate <- 40
range.vector <- 0:100

par(mfrow = c(1,3))

PDF.Poisson <- dpois(range.vector, lambda = blue.cells.per.plate)
plot(PDF.Poisson, type = "l", main = "Marcel's Swag", xlab = "# Blue cells/plate", ylab = "PDF")

CDF.Poisson <- ppois(range.vector, lambda = blue.cells.per.plate)
plot(CDF.Poisson, type = "l", main = "Avrami's Swag", xlab = "# Blue cells/plate", ylab = "CDF")

PDF.Exp <- dexp(range.vector, rate = blue.cells.per.plate)
plot(PDF.Exp, type = "l")
