# Dependent events and Conditional Probability - Whitlock(Section 5.8 and 5.9)


In many species, the mother can alter the relative numbers of male and female offspring depending on the local environment. In this case the "sex of the offspring" and the "environment" are dependent on each other.

The *Nasonia vitripennis* is a parasite that lays eggs on the pupae of flies. If the host has not been already parasitized, than it lays more female eggs, where as if the host has already been parasitized than it lays more male eggs. Therefore the sex of the offspring depends on the status of the pupae.

Suppose:
- *Pr[Host is parasitized] = 0.2*
- *Pr[Host is unparasitized] = 0.8*
- *Pr[male egg | Host is unparasitized ] = 0.05* probability that female lays male egg **given that** Host is unparasitized.
- *Pr[female egg | Host is unparasitized ] = 0.95* 
- *Pr[male egg | Host is parasitized] = 0.90* probability that female lays male egg **given that** host is parasitized
- *Pr[female egg | Host is parasitized] = 0.10*

What is the probability that a new, randomly chosen egg, is male?

## Law of total probability

Probability of and event A $Pr(A)$, is the sum of the product of Probability of B $Pr(B)$ times the conditional probability of A given B, $Pr(A|B)$ for all possible values of B.

$Pr[male egg] = Pr[male egg | Host is unparasitized ] * Pr[Host is unparasitized] + Pr[male egg | Host is parasitized] *Pr[Host is parasitized]$

$$Pr[A] = \sum_{all-values-of-B}{Pr[B] * Pr[A|B]}$$

## General Multiplication Rule

We can determine the probability of both events even with the conditional probability. It is simply the probability of the first event times the probability of the second event given the first has occurred.

$$Pr[A and B] = Pr[A] * Pr[B|A]$$
Of'course this means the reverse is true as well.

$$Pr[A and B] = Pr[B] * Pr[A|B]$$

## Bayes' theorem

Given the multiplication rule, we can derive an incredibly useful formula called the **Bayes' Theorem**

$$Pr[B] * Pr[A|B] = Pr[A] * Pr[B|A]$$
$$Pr[A|B] = \frac{Pr[A] * Pr[B|A]}{Pr[B]}$$

## Example 5.9

Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition that occurs in 1/1000 pregnancies. There is a test called triple test which looks for three hormone concentrations around week 16 which is used to calculate the probability of DS.

- **True Positive** - The test was positive and the fetus does have DS $Pr[Pos|DS^+]$
- **False Negative** - The test was negative, however the fetus has DS $Pr[Neg|DS^+]$
- **True Negative** - The test was negative and the fetus does not have DS $Pr[Neg|DS^-]$
- **False Positive** - Test was positive but the fetus does not have DS $Pr[Pos|DS^-]$

Sensitivity of the test is 0.6, which is the probability that a fetus with DS will be correctly scored as Pos. The False positive rate of the test, incorrectly label fetus as DS, is 0.05. If the test on a random fetus gives a $Pos$ result, what is the probability that fetus actually is $DS^+$

Using the Bayes' theorem above, let's set A to be the test $[Pos|Neg]$ and B to be DS status $[DS^+|DS^-]$


$$Pr[DS^+|Pos] = \frac{Pr[Pos|DS^+] * Pr[DS^+]}{Pr[Pos]}$$

We are given the values for the numerator but we need the values for the denominator.
For this we can use our **law of total probability**.

$$Pr[DS^+|Pos] = \frac{Pr[Pos|DS^+] * Pr[DS^+]}{Pr[DS^+] * Pr[Pos|DS^+] + Pr[DS^-]*Pr[Pos|DS^-]}$$

- $Pr[DS^+]$ = 0.001
- $Pr[DS^-]$ = 0.999
- $Pr[Pos|DS^+]$ = 0.6
- $Pr[Pos|DS^-]$ = 0.05

$$Pr[DS^+|Pos] = \frac{0.6*0.001}{0.6*0.001 + 0.999*0.05}$$
```{r}
result = 0.6*0.001 / (0.6*0.001 + 0.999*0.05)

```

The answer is ``r round(result*100, 2)``%.

## In class exercise: Q36, 37

Some people are hypersensitive to the smell of asparagus, and can even detect a strong odor in the urine of a person who has recently eaten asparagus. This trait turns out to have a simple genetic basis. An individual with one or two copies of the $A$ allele at the gene ($AA$ or $Aa$ genotypes) can smell asparagus in urine, whereas a person with two copies of the alternative $a$ allele ($aa$ genotypes) cannot (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 2019). Assume that men and women in the population have the same allele frequencies at the asparagus-smelling gene and that marriage and child production are independent of the genotype at the gene. In the human population, 5% of alleles are $A$ and 95% are $a$. 

- (a) What is the probability that a randomly sampled individual from the population has two copies of the $a$ allele (that is, that it has an $aa$ genotype)? 

```{r}
Pr=list()
Pr$a=0.95
Pr$A=0.05

Pr$aa=Pr$a*Pr$a
Pr$aa
```

- (b) What is the probability that both members of a randomly sampled married couple (man and woman) are $aa$ at the asparagus-smelling gene? 

```{r}
Pr$aa_aa = Pr$aa * Pr$aa
Pr$aa_aa

```

- (c) What is the probability that both members of a randomly sampled married couple (man and woman) are heterozygotes at this locus (meaning that each person has one allele A and one allele a)? 

```{r}
# first calculate probability of Heterozygous
# Aa and aA are the same, so multiply by 2.
Pr$Aa = Pr$A * Pr$a + Pr$a * Pr$A

Pr$Aa_Aa = Pr$Aa * Pr$Aa
Pr$Aa_Aa        
```

- (d) Consider the type of couple described in (c). What is the probability that the first child of such a couple also has one A allele and one a allele (is a heterozygote)? Remember that the child must receive exactly one allele from each parent. 

```{r}
# if both parents are Aa, than we can draw a table
knitr::kable(data.frame(A=c("AA","aA"),
                 a=c("Aa","aa"),
                 row.names = c("A","a")))
```

```{r}
# out of 4 different outcomes, 2 are heterozygous so 

```

$$Pr[C_{Aa} | (M_{Aa})*(F_{Aa})] = 0.5$$

- (e) If a randomly sampled child has the aa genotype, what is the probability that both its parents were also aa?

$$ A = Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})]$$
$$ B = Pr[C_{aa}]$$

$$Pr[(F_{aa}) * (M_{aa}) | C_{aa}] = \frac{Pr[C_{aa}]|Pr(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})]}{Pr[C_{aa}]}$$
To calculate $Pr[C_{aa}]$ we need to consider all possible combinations of parents

$$Pr[C_{aa}] = $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{Aa})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{Aa})*(M_{aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{AA})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{AA})*(M_{aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{aa})*(M_{Aa})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{Aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{Aa})*(M_{Aa})] * Pr[(F_{Aa})*(M_{Aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{AA})*(M_{Aa})] * Pr[(F_{AA})*(M_{Aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{aa})*(M_{AA})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{AA})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{Aa})*(M_{AA})] * Pr[(F_{Aa})*(M_{AA})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{AA})*(M_{AA})] * Pr[(F_{AA})*(M_{AA})] $$
```{r}

# For all conditional probability where both parent do not have an _a_ allele can be removed because it will be 0.
```
$$Pr[C_{aa}] = $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{Aa})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{Aa})*(M_{aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{aa})*(M_{Aa})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{Aa})] + $$
$$Pr[C_{aa}]|(F_{Aa})*(M_{Aa})] * Pr[(F_{Aa})*(M_{Aa})]$$

```{r}
Pr$Caa_Maa_Faa = 1 #* Pr$aa_aa # prob that child is aa if parents are aa is 1
Pr$Caa_Maa_FAa = 0.5 #* Pr$aa * Pr$Aa # think punnett square like we did above
Pr$Caa_MAa_Faa = 0.5 #* Pr$Aa * Pr$aa
Pr$Caa_MAa_FAa = 0.25 #* Pr$Aa * Pr$Aa

Pr$Caa = Pr$Caa_Maa_Faa * Pr$aa * Pr$aa +
         Pr$Caa_Maa_FAa * Pr$aa * Pr$Aa + 
         Pr$Caa_MAa_Faa * Pr$Aa * Pr$aa +
         Pr$Caa_MAa_FAa * Pr$Aa * Pr$Aa
```

Plugging this into the original equation
$$Pr[(F_{aa}) * (M_{aa}) | C_{aa}] = \frac{Pr[C_{aa}]|Pr(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})] * Pr[(F_{aa})*(M_{aa})]}{Pr[C_{aa}]}$$
```{r}
Pr$Caa_Maa_Faa * Pr$aa_aa / Pr$Caa

```
