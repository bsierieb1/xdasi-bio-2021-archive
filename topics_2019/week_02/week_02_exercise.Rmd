## Enter the R code for each question in the code chunk.

1) Download the file [expvalues.txt](expvalues.txt) and load it into your workspace. 
Make sure to check if it has loaded correctly.

```{r}

```

2) Use the summary() function to learn more about the dataset.

```{r}


```

3) A quick way to determine if the data is normalized 
and ready for analysis is to create a boxplot. 
Create a boxplot of the dataframe.

```{r}

```

3) Does the data look like it's normalized?

```{r}

```

4) Use a built-in function in R to find the lowest value in your dataframe. 
Save the lowest value in the dataframe and call lowValue 

```{r}

```


5) What is the difference between the highest value in the dataframe and the lowest value (lowValue)?

```{r}

```
