## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

For more details on using R Markdown see **<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>**.

You can also refer to the R Markdown Cheatsheet, which may be found here: **<https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>**

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. For example:

```{r test}
hiya <- paste("Hello","world!",sep = " ")
hiya
```

## Embedding Graphics

You can include plots by writing R code to generate them, for example:

```{r normal_density, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE }

x<-seq(-4,4,0.1)
y <- dnorm(x)
plot(x,y,type="h", xlab="Z-score", ylab="Density")
lines(x,y,col="purple", lwd=2)
```

## Controlling code output

Note that the `echo = TRUE` and `eval = TRUE` parameters cause both the R code that generated the plot and the output to be displayed.

* Setting `echo = FALSE` would hide the code block.
* Setting  `eval = FALSE` would prevent the code block from being run.
* The defaults are TRUE, so they are not needed (we show them here for illustrative purposes).

## Writing equations

The above is a *density plot* for the **Standard Normal Distribution**:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$

We have posted an .Rmd version of this document on the course GitHub repository for reference.
