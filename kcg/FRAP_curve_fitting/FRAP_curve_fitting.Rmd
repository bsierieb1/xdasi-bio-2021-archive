```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```


Load FRAP data

```{r}

```


### e. Calculate recovery rates and test for significant differences

These curves look pretty different. One way to quantify this is to calculate the recovery rates and compare them using a statistical test.

```{r}
# max recovery rates
A.WT = frap %>% filter(strain == "WT") %>% summarize(max(norm.Intensity))

```



**a)** Fit the curves to an exponential distribution and retrieve the lambda parameter.

```{r}
library(fitdistrplus)

wt.dist = frap.norm.summary %>% 
  filter(strain == "WT" & Time >= 0)
wt.dist = wt.dist$i.mean

mut.dist = frap.norm.summary %>% 
  filter(strain == "mip1uae1" & Time >= 0)
mut.dist = mut.dist$i.mean



```
