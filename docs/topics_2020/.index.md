### Overview

Reading and homework assignments, class notes, and in-class exercises will be posted here on a weekly basis. For students who cannot attend the "synchronous" portion of the course, recordings of each class will also be posted here.

#### Textbook and References

+ Regular reading assignments will include chapters from Whitlock and Schluter, ***The Analysis of Biological Data, ed. 3***.
+ We will supplement the primary text(s) with additional material in the form of chapters from other books, or review articles on special topics.
+ For students wishing a more mathematical treatment of various topics, we often provide links to chapters from Ken Aho, ***Foundational and Applied Statistics***. _Most of the time these will be optional, but occasional readings from this text may be mandatory._

#### Assignments

+ Each week you will be expected to complete a ***Pre-class assignment*** that will usually consist of a reading assignment, and sometimes a self-test or exercise. It is important that you complete these on schedule.
+ Weekly ***Homework assignments*** will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm, and will be submitted through **NYU Classes**.
