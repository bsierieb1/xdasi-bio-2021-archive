# Installing R and RStudio

The **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)** maintains and distributes up-to-date versions of R binaries and source code for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. You will want to download and install _**precompiled binaries**_ for the operating system you are running on your laptop (just follow the installation instructions provided).

  - As of May 19, 2021, the **latest version is R 4.1.0**.

**RStudio** is the popular IDE we will use in this course to help us manage our R data and code. To install RStudio on your computer, you first need to download and install **R**, and then install RStudio. Make sure you select the open-source **RStudio Desktop** (you don't need the server version).
