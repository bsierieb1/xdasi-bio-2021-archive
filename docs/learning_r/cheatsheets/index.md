# Quick guides for R commands and syntax!

### RStudio

RStudio maintains a whole gaggle of cheat sheets on pretty much any R topic you can think of. You can find a gallery of them on their website [**here**.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ide)

* [**Base R Commands**](RStudio_r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf) This is the first place to start.
+ [**R Markdown** Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
+ [**R Markdown** Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
* [**ggplot2**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

### LaTeX
What is LaTeX? It is a typesetting system that uses plain text to encode mathematical symbols for rendering upon publication (such as turning your .Rmd file into a .pdf file). It allows the proper formatting of complex mathematical expressions, and all the special characters that are needed to write them.

How do you pronounce it? The 'X' is often pronounced as 'k', after the Greek symbol Chi.

There are a lot of LaTeX references online. Here are a few:
* [**RStudio: LaTeX Cheatsheet**](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet.pdf)
* [**LaTeX Math Symbols (quick guide)**](LATEX_Math_Symbols_short.pdf)
A condensed list of the LaTeX notation you will need to write mathematical expressions using LaTeX.
* [**LaTeX Math Symbols (comprehensive)**](LATEX_Math_Symbols_long.pdf)
An expansive compendium of all the LaTeX notation you will ever need.
* [**AoPS: LaTeX Symbols**](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols)
A short online list of LaTeX symbols from the Art of Problem Solving website, which also contains links to a lot of other resources for writing and drawing mathematical concepts.
