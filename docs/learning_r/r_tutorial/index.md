# Where to go for help with R

### The Basics

The tutorials below provide an introduction to the basic building blocks for programming in R. Each contains links to YouTube videos that walk you through different topics. Ideally you should watch the video first and then read and repeat the code at your own pace.

* [**R Tutorial**](introduction_to_r/index.md)
    + Contains instructions on installing and getting going with R and R Studio.

* [**R Data  Structures**](RDataStructures.md)
    + The basic building blocks of working with data.

### Manny Katari's video tutorials

If you would rather watch all videos back to back first, feel free to watch the different playlists:

* [**Intro to R Videos**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9k4CPCZjhyLgE7RgQI0moWiPqLsg2o_)

* [**Writing Functions in R Videos**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9k4CPCZjhy2xwsuZh-ZpVDjH4iWU6Nh)


### Interactive Tutorials

* [**DataCamp**](https://datacamp.com)
    + We have set up a DataCamp custom course for you that will be freely accessible throughout the semester. The modules we have selected cover R data structures, operations, functions, data manipulation, programming concepts, and visualization. You will work through these during the first few weeks of the semester.

* [**Swirl Website**](https://swirlstats.com)
    + You may also wish to work your way through the **swirl** tutorial that comes with RStudio. Similar to the DataCamp series, it provides interactive feedback and covers the basic commands and data structures that we will use throughout the course. Since it runs through your R console instead of a browser, you can work through this anytime on your own without needing to be online. To use it, follow the simple instructions at the link above.


### Useful R Functions

* [**Syntax Equivalents: Base R vs. Tidyverse**](base-r_tidyverse_equivalents.html)
  + A comparison of basic syntax for working with data frames, by Hugo Tavares.
* [**Introduction to functions for probability distributions (d, q, p, r)**](Intro_R_dqpr_functions.html)
  + Random sampling, PDF, CDF, and inverse CDF functions for standard probability distributions

### Graphics

  * [**R Graphics Overview**](graphics/graphics.html) (xdas) * [**Base R
  * Plotting**](graphics/base_r_plotting.html) (xdas) *
  * [**ggplot2**](graphics/ggplot2.html) (xdas)


### Cheat Sheets and Quick Reference

* [**RStudio Cheat Sheets**](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)  _includes dplyr, ggplot2, R Markdown, and many others_
  * [**RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet**](rstudio-ide.pdf)
  * [**R Markdown Cheatsheets**](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

You can also find these cheatsheets and other help topics in R studio under **"Help=>Cheatsheets"**.

### Data Wrangling in R for Data Science (mainly tidyverse utilities)

* [**Tidyverse**](http://www.tidyverse.org)  _dplyr, ggplot2, tibbles, and other packages in the tidy universe_

* [**Data Carpentry: Data Analyis and Visualization in R for Ecologists**](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)

* [**Dat Science for Psychologists**](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/)


### Additional Resources

There are many other R tutorials and reference materials online. Here are a few to get you started:

* [**R tutorial - NYU Gencore**](https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/rna-seq-analysis/introduction-to-r/) _basic R tutorial similar to the one provided here_

* [**Quick-R**](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html) _all the basics, with standard statistical methods and built-in graphics \(does not cover dplyr and ggplot2\)_

* [**Introduction to R**](Intro_to_R_Aho.pdf)  _Electronic supplement to Aho textbook_
