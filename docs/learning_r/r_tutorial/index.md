The tutorials in this section provide an introduction to the basic building blocks for programming in R: operators, variables, functions, data structures, reading and writing data files, graphics, R Markdown, and working with packages.

After reading through each topic, you should repeat the code at your own pace and try out applying them to new cases to make sure you have mastered each skill. We will get lots of practice with all of these during the course!

In addition, below are links to additional materials you may find useful for learning R programming.

# Interactive Tutorials

* [**DataCamp**](https://datacamp.com)
    + We have set up a DataCamp custom course for you that will be freely accessible throughout the semester. The modules we have selected cover R data structures, operations, functions, data manipulation, and visualization. These are not required but you may want to work through some of the courses and assessments for extra practice.

* [**Swirl Website**](https://swirlstats.com)
    + You may also wish to work your way through the **swirl** tutorial that comes with RStudio. Similar to the DataCamp series, it provides interactive feedback and covers the basic commands and data structures that we will use throughout the course. Since it runs through your R console instead of a browser, you can work through this anytime on your own without needing to be online. To use it, follow the simple instructions at the link above.
