# Help with commands, syntax, and more!

**Can't remember a command or some basic syntax? You'll find (links to) everything you need here!**{: .text-green-200}

Over the last few years, there has been a huge explosion of online resources for learning R, including:

+ Cheatsheets
+ Quick guides
+ Tutorials - _(ome sites offer interactive training courses)_
+ Bookdown books - _I've found some of these to be really useful, either for a quick review of key concepts, or for an in-depth treatment of a specific topic._
+ Books available in print, PDF, and/or eBooks - _Old-school reference books and manuals still rock! NYU provides free access to lots of books on R programming, many of which can be read online or downloaded as PDFs._
+ Graphics recipes and galleries - _How to choose different visual representations and how to create them_

Here we provide links to many resources for programming in R. We will refer you to some of these during the semester. If you find more that you really like, please let us know and we can add them to these lists!

# A Note about Google and StackExchange

We know that the first thing most of us do is to use the **Google** search engine to get quick answers to anything and everything in the world. Google is really powerful and sometimes you get what you're looking for right away.

**HOWEVER, you can also easily get lost going down a rabbit hole at places like StackExchange.**{: .text-red-200} If you find that you're spending more than a few minutes trying to find what you are looking for, please take a look at one of the following sites, which provide systematic, organized information on a variety of topics.

# Cheatsheets

You can find a few really helpful cheatsheets and other help topics in RStudio under **"Help=>Cheatsheets"**. Links to several relevant cheatsheets organized according to topic are included below.

The RStudio website also maintains an [extensive list](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) of cheatsheets on all kinds of topics (almost too many! and not that well organized ...)

Links to cheatsheets on different topics are included within their respective pages in this section.

# Interactive Tutorials

* [**DataCamp**](https://datacamp.com)
    + We have set up a DataCamp custom course for you that will be freely accessible throughout the semester. The modules we have selected cover R data structures, operations, functions, data manipulation, and visualization. These are not required but you may want to work through some of the courses and assessments for extra practice.

* [**Swirl Website**](https://swirlstats.com)
    + You may also wish to work your way through the **swirl** tutorial that comes with RStudio. Similar to the DataCamp series, it provides interactive feedback and covers the basic commands and data structures that we will use throughout the course. Since it runs through your R console instead of a browser, you can work through this anytime on your own without needing to be online. To use it, follow the simple instructions at the link above.
