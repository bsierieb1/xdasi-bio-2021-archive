# Installing R and RStudio

RStudio is the popular IDE we will use in this course to help us manage our R data and code. To install RStudio on your computer, you first need to download and install R, and then install RStudio. These can be downloaded from the following sites:

* [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

If you are installing R on a Windows machine, you should also download and install [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
