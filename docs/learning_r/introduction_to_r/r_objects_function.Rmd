### R Objects

#### YouTube Video: [R Objects](https://youtu.be/8GXsn8qd7Gc)

An R object that is stored in the R environment is simply a container for data or lines of code. Objects can be named so they can be accessed at any point. There are three ways to assign data to a named object:

``` r
x <- 1
x
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
assign("y", 1)
y
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
z = 1
z
```

    ## [1] 1

You can add comments to your code by preceding them with the \# sign. Any text to the right of the hashtag will be ignored by the interpreter (i.e. it will not be executed as code).

``` r
x<-1 # everything on the right side is a comment.
```

## R Functions

Functions contain lines of pre-written code that perform some task. They can be used to:
- Gather information about R environment
- Change properties of an environment
- Perform tasks on one or more data structures

Below is an example of the function sum():

``` r
a = 6
b <- 9
c = 15
55 -> e # notice that here the variable is on the right.
        # this only works with the arrow operator
d = sum(a,b,c,e)
d
```

## Basic Syntax

In order to see the contents of an object, you can simply type the name of the object. If you type a word that is not an object, you will get an error. Names of objects are case sensitive, so "Print" is not the same as "print":

``` r
# Try typing the word hello
hello
```

In a case when not all the code can fit in one line, or you want to make the command more readable, you can press **Return** and R will simply start the prompt with `+`:

``` r
x<-1
print(
x)
```

## Getting Help with Functions and Features

Below are some examples of how to get help about a command.

``` r
# Different commands to get help for a command
help(sum)
?sum


# In case you donâ€™t know the full name of the command
apropos("mean")
```

    ##  [1] ".colMeans"     ".rowMeans"     "colMeans"      "kmeans"       
    ##  [5] "mean"          "mean.Date"     "mean.default"  "mean.difftime"
    ##  [9] "mean.POSIXct"  "mean.POSIXlt"  "meanabsdev"    "rowMeans"     
    ## [13] "weighted.mean"

``` r
# To only get an example of how to use the command
example("mean")
```

    ##
    ## mean> x <- c(0:10, 50)
    ##
    ## mean> xm <- mean(x)
    ##
    ## mean> c(xm, mean(x, trim = 0.10))
    ## [1] 8.75 5.50
