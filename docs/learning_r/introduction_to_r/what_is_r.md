## What is R

* R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
* It is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories \(formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies\) by John Chambers.
* One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.
* Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

## The R environment

* an effective data handling and storage facility
* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices
* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis
* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or on hardcopy
* well developed, simple and effective programming language \(called "S"\) which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
