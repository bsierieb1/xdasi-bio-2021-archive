# R objects: Vectors

Most basic data structure Sequence of data that can be numbers, characters and also logical. Scalar is a vector of length 1. Vector of more than one element can be created using c\(\) function. Elements of vector must be same type and mode. Characters must be enclosed in either single or double quotes Missing data can be represented as NA

## R objects: Character Vectors

Denoted by double quotes "x-values", "New iteration results"

```r
Escape characters \
\\  to use \ in string
\" to use " in string
\n new line character
\t tab character
\b backspace character
```

## R object: Logical Vectors

### A vector with three possible values:

TRUE, FALSE, NA \(Not available\)

### Are generated by conditions.

temp&lt;- x &gt; 13

### List of Logical operators

&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, == for exact equality != for inequality & \(and\) \| \(or\)

### Vector examples

```r
v <- c(4,2,3,8,2,2,5)
v
```

```
## [1] 4 2 3 8 2 2 5
```

```r
is(v)
```

```
## [1] "numeric" "vector"
```

```r
v <- c("a","b","c","d","e")
v
```

```
## [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"
```

```r
is(v)
```

```
## [1] "character"           "vector"              "data.frameRowLabels"
## [4] "SuperClassMethod"
```

```r
v <- c(4,2,3,8,2,2,NA,5)
v
```

```
## [1]  4  2  3  8  2  2 NA  5
```

```r
#changing values in a vector
v[4]
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
v[4] = 10

v < 4
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE    NA FALSE
```

```r
v[1:3]
```

```
## [1] 4 2 3
```

```r
v[-c(1,5,8)]
```

```
## [1]  2  3 10  2 NA
```

```r
# equivalent expressions
temp = v < 4
v[temp]
```

```
## [1]  2  3  2  2 NA
```

```r
# same as below
v[v<4]
```

```
## [1]  2  3  2  2 NA
```



## Create a new numeric vector

Note that the NA is acceptable because it is not a character, but a special value which stands for **not available**

```{r}
v <- c(4,2,3,8,2,2,NA,5)
v
```

To retrieve a value from a vector you use \[ *index* \]. The index can be:
- numerical values representing position
- names given to the positions in the vector
- logical vector where the values in the **True** positions are reported

```{r}
v[4]
```

```{r}
#changing values in a vector
v[4] = 10
v
```

Create a logical vector

```{r}
v < 4
```

Subset a set of values. The **:** between the numbers is a short cut for range. So `1:3` is equivalent to `c(1,2,3)`

```{r}
v[1:3]
```

You can also ask for the opposite of the selection

```{r}
v[-c(1,5,8)]
```

```{r}
# equivalent expressions
temp = v < 4
temp
```

Note that temp is a logical vector that we can use to retrieve values.

```{r}
v[temp]
```


let's put letters as labels for the vector v so we can retrieve values based on it's name. Note there are several helpful datasets and functions that we can take advantage of in R. One such variable is **letters**. Here we are assigning the attribute **names** of **v** to the first 8 letters of the alphabet.

```{r}
names(v) = letters[1:8]
```

```{r}
v
```

Now instead of positions, we can also use their names.

```{r}
v[c("a","c")]
```
