# Data Structures


# Data Types

Data analysis is about working with data, after all! Since there are many different kinds of data, R can store several different types of data:

+ Numeric : numbers (integers or floating-point)
+ Character: Alphanumeric values
+ Logical : True/False
+ Complex : complex numbers (i = square root of -1)
+ Raw : Bytes (for example images)

R has multiple kinds of containers for holding data, which are called "Objects". Here we describe the main classes of objects used to perform data analysis in R.
