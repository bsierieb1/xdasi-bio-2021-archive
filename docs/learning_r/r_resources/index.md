# A note about Google and StackExchange

The first thing most people do when they want to get some quick information about R commands and syntax is to use the Google search engine. Google often directs you to something useful, and sometimes you get what you're looking for right away.

**HOWEVER, you can also easily get lost going down a rabbit hole at places like StackExchange.**: .text-green-200} If you find that you're spending more than a few minutes trying to find what you are looking for, please take a look at one of the following sites, which provide systematic, organized information on a variety of topics.

I've found some **online books** to be really useful, either for a quick review of key concepts, or for an in-depth treatment of a specific topic.

Below are some lists of online resources for programming in R and related topics. We will refer you to some of these during the semester. Feel free to let us know if you find something you think should be added to these lists!
