# Textbook and Reference Materials

## Statistics Texts

*   The textbook we will use is called ***The Analysis of Biological Data*** by Whitlock and Schluter, 3rd edition. You may either purchase a hard copy or purchase / rent an e-copy from [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B081ZH5PL2).

*   Additional assigned reading will draw from a variety of reference books and other informational resources. The course syllabus, reading assignments, lab exercises, tutorials, and links to useful resources will be posted on the **[course website](https://xdasi.bio.nyu.edu/)**.

## R Coding

*   There are many online resources for learning R. Some of these are listed on this website under **R Resources**. Students will be pointed to relevant references throughout the semester.

*   Students will have free access to ***[DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/)*** for the duration of the course. Students with little or no experience in R programming are encouraged to **complete the first series of online tutorials prior to the first class** in order to familiarize them with R programming concepts, syntax, operators, and data structures.

*   All NYU students have free access to electronic versions of a large number of the ***technical programming manuals*** (R, Python, etc.) through NYUâ€™s subscription to ProQuest. You can access it through the **[NYU Library](https://guides.nyu.edu/az.php?q=safari)** or through this **[persistent link](https://persistent.library.nyu.edu/arch/NYU01272)** (requires NYU two-factor authentication; you will be redirected automatically).
