- each graph consists of 3 elements:
	Data elements: the numbers and the categories visually represented + the title.
	Structural elements: the axes, the ticks, the legend, the grid, etc.
	Decorations: extra colors, shapes, artistic drawings etc.
Maximizing the data elements ensures the audience's attention is on the data

- Gestalt principles: humans generally perceive patterns rather than individual objects!
	* similarity: we perceive similar objects as a group
	* proximity: when we see distinct objects close to each other, we perceive them as a group
	* enclosure: when we see a set of distinct elements enclosed inside a visual form, we perceive them as a group
	* connection: when we see distinct objects connected by some kind of a visual form (e.g. a line), we perceive them as a group
connection & enclosure are stronger than proximity & similarity

- how to choose aspect ratio?
