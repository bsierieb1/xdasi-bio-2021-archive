Reading, class notes, and in-class exercises will be posted here on a weekly basis. For students who cannot attend the "synchronous" portion of the course, recordings of each class will also be posted here.

# Textbook and References

+ Regular reading assignments will include chapters from **The Analysis of Biological Data, ed. 3** by _Whitlock and Schluter_.
+ We will supplement the primary text(s) with additional material in the form of chapters from other books, review articles on special topics, interactive tutorials, short videos, or other online resources.
+ For students wishing a more mathematical treatment of various topics, we will provide links to some chapters from **Foundational and Applied Statistics** by _Ken Aho_.

# Assignments

+ A ***Pre-class reading assignment*** for each new topic will be assigned on a regular basis.
  + To help focus your attention, a set of study questions covering the main concepts in each chapter will be posted together with the assignment.
  + It is important that you complete these on schedule.
+ Classes will begin with a ***5-minute quiz*** consisting of 5 random questions from the study questions assigned for each chapter in the textbook.
+ Weekly ***Homework assignments*** will posted and should be submitted on **Brightspace**. These will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm.
