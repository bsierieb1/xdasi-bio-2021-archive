## Basic concepts in statistics

1. What is the field of statistics about?
  + Methods to measure aspects of populations and quantify uncertainty
  + Estimation: infer an unknown quantity of a population based on samples
  + Hypothesis testing
  + Sampling error: accuracy / precision,  random samples / bias
2. What kinds of questions are asked?
  + Exploratory analysis
  + Inference about a population based on a sample
  + Correlations between variables (correlation is not causation)
  + Prediction of unknown samples
3. Types of studies
  + Experimental vs. observational
4. Data types and variables
  + Categorical: nominal vs. ordinal
  + Numerical: discrete vs. continuous
