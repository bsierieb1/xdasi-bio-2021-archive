## Example

**Aho, Ex. 6.10 (also see Fig. 6.7)**

Surprisingly, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is negatively associatd with moderate smoking, possibly because nicotine may reduce apoptosis (programmed cell death) of neurons. The description of the problem is as follows:

</div>

### What is the question?

Researchers were interested in being able to detect a 7% reduction in Alzheimer's for patients smoking 10-20 cigarettes a day, given that $\sigma=45\%$.

Is a sample size of 200 sufficient to detect this effect size given $\alpha=0.05$?

+ What are $H_o$ and $H_A$?
+ Can we assume that the sampling distribution of the sample mean, $\bar{X}$, is normal?
+ What type of test should we use?
+ What is the critical value for the test?

```{r}
# your answer here
```


### Manual power calculation

First, compute the power by hand:

```{r, collapse=T}
# =================================================== #
# set up variables

effect.size = -7  # effect size = Exp(X) under H_A
n = 200
sigma = 45
alpha = 0.05
type = "one.sample" # one or two sample
alt = "one.sided"  # one- or two-sided

# set Exp(X) = 0 under null H_o

# critical value (z*) for lower-tail test at alpha=0.05
z.crit = qnorm(alpha)  # -1.644854

# check alpha using standard normal distribution
pnorm(0,abs(z.crit),lower.tail=T)  # 0.05

# compute SEM for sample size
sem = sigma/sqrt(n)
sem

# =================================================== #
# manual power calculation

# compute power using area under the curve for H_A

# get value of critical x at z.crit for H_A
# want P( X.bar  <= z.crit * sem)
# percent difference for lower-tail significance
x.crit = z.crit*sem  # x-value at critical z-score 
x.crit

# Expected X.bar (pop. mean) under H_A is (mu_o - mu_A): Exp(X) = -7
pwr = pnorm(x.crit, mean = effect.size, sd = sem)  # power = 0.71
pwr

# check z-score for H_A at expected power
qnorm(pwr, effect.size, sem)  # alpha = P(X.bar <= -5.24)
```

### Compute power in R

Given any 4 of the 5 variables that go into the power equation, we can use `power.t.test()` to compute the missing value. Since $n$ is large, we could also use the `power.z.test()` command from the `asbio` package. These give slightly different results, as the $t$-test is a bit more conservative. (They also use different names for their arguments, and the objects the produce are also different.)

**NOTE:** *Effect size used for these functions should be given as a positive number, otherwise these functions will not work as expected.*

```{r}
# ================================================== #
# provide expected effect size as a positive number
power.t.test(n, delta = abs(effect.size), sd = sigma, sig.level = alpha,
             type="one.sample", alternative="one.sided", strict=T)

# note that arguments for this command differ
power.z.test(n, effect = abs(effect.size), sigma = sigma, 
             alpha = alpha, test="one.tail", strict=T)
```


### What if you change different variables that influence power?
 
+ Increase effect size => increase power (reduce Type II error)
+ Increase sample size => increase power (reduce Type II error)
+ Raise $\alpha$       => lower stringency (increase Type I error)

We can compute the new power by hand, or use the `power.z.test()` command:

```{r}
# ================================================== #
# increase effect size
# ================================================== #
# what happens if E = -8? => increase power
# (keep alpha the same)
pnorm(x.crit, effect.size - 1, sem)  # power = 0.81

power.z.test(n, effect = -(effect.size-1), sigma = sigma, 
             alpha = alpha, test="one.tail", strict=T)

# ================================================== #
# increase sample size
# ================================================== #
# what if sample size = 300? => more power for same E
# (keep alpha the same)
n = 300

# get x-bar and SEM
sem = sigma / sqrt(n)
sem
x.crit = qnorm(0.05)*sem
x.crit

# power
pnorm(x.crit, effect.size, sem)  # power = 0.85

power.z.test(n, effect = -effect.size, sigma = sigma, 
             alpha = alpha, test="one.tail", strict=T)

# ================================================== #
# relax stringency: raise alpha
# ================================================== #
# raising alpha increases Type I error
# what happens to power? => power goes down
alpha = 0.2
z.crit = qnorm(alpha)  # -0.842

# check alpha2 using standard normal distribution
pnorm(0,abs(z.crit),lower.tail=T)

x.crit = z.crit*sem
x.crit

pwr = pnorm(x.crit, mean = effect.size, sd = sem)  # power = 0.913
pwr

qnorm(pwr, effect.size, sem) # check power

# power is the same with the z-test power function
power.z.test(n, effect = -effect.size, sigma = sigma, 
             alpha = alpha, test="one.tail", strict=T)
```


### Design for a targeted power

What if you want to design the experiment for power = 0.8, for the same sample
size and effect size? What is the Type II error? What happens to the Type I error?

```{r}
# ================================================== #
# increase desired power to 0.8
# ================================================== #
# if raise desired power without increasing effect size,
#   => alpha goes up (less stringent)
x.bar2 = qnorm(0.8, effect.size, sem) # effect size -4.32
x.bar2

# what significance level is this?
alpha2 = x.bar2 / sem
alpha2
pnorm(0,abs(alpha2),lower.tail=T)  # 0.087

# what significance level is this?
alpha2 = x.bar2 / sem
alpha2
pnorm(0,abs(alpha2),lower.tail=T)  # 0.087

# ================================================== #
# using power.t.test command
# now supply power and ask what new alpha is
power.t.test(n, delta = -effect.size, sd = sigma, 
             sig.level = NULL, power = 0.8,
            type="one.sample", alternative="one.sided", strict=T)
# gives alpha = 0.088
```
