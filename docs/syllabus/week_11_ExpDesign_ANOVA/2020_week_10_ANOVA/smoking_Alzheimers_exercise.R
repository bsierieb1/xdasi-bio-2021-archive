## effect of smoking on Alzheimer's

# parameters
E =
n = 
sigma = 
alpha = 
pwr = 
type =  # one or two sample
alt =   # one- or two-sided

# critical value (z*) for test


# get x-bar and SEM


# power

# check power

# ================================================== #
# ================================================== #
# what if you want power = 0.8? => effect on alpha?


# what significance level is this?


# ================================================== #
# what if sample size = 300? => effect on power?
n2 = 

# get x-bar and SEM


# power


# ================================================== #
# what if effect size were larger for n=200? say -8%?
