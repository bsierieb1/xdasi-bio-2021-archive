## Normal distribution

The normal distribution is the most common distribution in statistics and has many applications in biology. It is important because it represents many processes in which the most likely outcome is the average. Large sums of (small) random variables are often normally distributed.

The Normal distribution is a **continuous** distribution with a characteristic bell shape, the precise dimensions of which are governed by its mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. 

We say that "a random variable follows a normal distribution with mean mu and variance sigma" and notate this as $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$, where $Exp(X) = \mu$ and $Var(X) = \sigma^2$. 

The mathematical description of a normal distribution is:

PDF: $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} 
               \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2} $$

CDF: $$ F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
               \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} 
               \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}dx = 1 $$

where:

1. Outcomes $x$ are continuous and independent.
2. $x \in \mathbb{R}$
3. $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$
4. $\sigma > 0$

Examples with different mean and SD are illustrated below.

## Standard normal
 
The standard normal distribution, or *Z-distribution*, is a normal or Gaussian distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$: $Z$ ~ $N(0,1)$

The normal distribution is standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing over the SD: 
          $$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

Any outcome $x_i$ from a normal distribution can be turned into a $z$-score in the same maner.

As with any other distribution, we can ask questions like, "What is the chance of observing a value of $x$ or less? $x$ or more? between $x$ and $y$?"

We can also use the **inverse CDF**, or the **_quantile_** function, to find the value for some percentile in the population (e.g. the femur length that 80% of the population is under, which could be a factor in setting the seat pitch in airplanes).

#### Empirical rule for the standard normal

There is a general rule of thumb about how much of a distribution falls within some number of standard deviations from the mean: a little over 2/3 of the data fall within 1SD, ~95% fall within 2SD, and ~99% fall within 3SD (left diagram below). If you were to sample any Normal distribution, it might look something like the histogram on the right.

```


#### What controls the shape of the distribution?

**_Bell-shaped curve_**: This is governed by the general formula $y = e^{-x^2}$. The height of this curve at $x = 0$ (i.e. the y-intercept) is $y = 1$. 

![Exponential bell curve](Images/Exponential_Bell_Curve.png){width=65%}

The total area under the curve $e^{-x^2}$ is:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi} \approx 1.77$$

**_Width and location of the curve_**: This is governed by the value of the exponent. The Normal distribution is expressed in terms of the mean, $\mu$, and the variance, $\sigma^2$, of the data. Substituting the exponent with the term ${-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$ gives a curve that is zero-centered around the mean $\mu$ and has a standard deviation of $\sigma$.


**_Area under the curve_**: In order to make the total probability equal to one, we use a scaling factor (let's call this a constant $C$) that is a multiplier of the exponential formula. This constant turns out to be $C = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}$.

Deriving these equations is not trivial. We end up with the magical number $\pi$ in the equation because it turns out that using a polar coordinate system, instead of Cartesian coordinates, is more natural to describe this shape. If you want to get an idea of how the Normal PDF is derived, check out this video on YouTube: [**Quick derivation of the Normal PDF (4'50")**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebewBjZmZTw) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebewBjZmZTw).

## Central limit theorem

The sampling distribution of sample means follows a normal distribution, making the normal distribution extremely useful for learning the properties of random samples. We covered the CLT in a previous class (see link to class notes above).


## Normal approximation of the binomial

When the sample size is large, and $p \approx 0.5$ (not too large or too small), the normal distribution is a very good approximation to the binomial.


## Example

The average weight of an adult female greyhound is 63 pounds, with a standard deviation of 8 pounds. What proportion of female greyhounds weigh less than or equal to 55 pounds?

```{r}
pnorm(55, mean = 63, sd = 8)
```

What proportion weigh between 60 and 65 pounds?

$$ P(60 \le X \le 65) = \int_{60}^{65}f(x)dx =\Big[ F(x) \Big]_{60}^{65}  \\
= \int_{-\infty}^{65}f(x)dx -  
               \int_{-\infty}^{60}f(x)dx = F(65) - F(60)  $$

```{r}
# note that you cannot use the summation method for a continuous distribution;
# you have to subtract CDF up to each point to get the probability for the interval
pnorm(65, mean = 63, sd = 8) - pnorm(60, mean = 63, sd = 8)
```

It can safely be said that 75% weigh no more than what amount? This is a question that calls for the quantile function (inverse CDF):

```{r}
qnorm(0.75, mean = 63, sd = 8)
```
