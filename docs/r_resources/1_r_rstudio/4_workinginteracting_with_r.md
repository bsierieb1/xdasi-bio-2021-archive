# Communicating with R

So, you have successfully installed R and RStudio, you've taken a tour of the windowing system, and you have a basic idea about managing R sessions and your working environment.

Now, you may want to learn how to "talk" to R and how to make sense of what it "tells" you.

Please refer to [Part I of "R Programming for Research"](https://geanders.github.io/RProgrammingForResearch/r-preliminaries.html){: target="blank"}. You may skip section 1.9 for now.
