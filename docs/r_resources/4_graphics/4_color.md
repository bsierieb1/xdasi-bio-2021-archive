Color is an important aspect of visual communication, and there is a lot of theory behind choosing colors. Color can be used for:

+ contrasting different categorical groups
+ distinguishing quantitative variables
+ highlighting information

# Color Codes

In Base R, different graph elements can be set using the `col` parameter (also col.axis, col.lab, col.main, col.sub). Other packages include additional functions for controlling colors (e.g. `fill` in ggplot2).

There are several ways to refer to colors in R:

  + **name** - e.g. `col="aquamarine4"` (also "blue", salmon", "violet", etc.)
    - use `colors()` to see a list of the 657 named colors in R
    - see [**this blog**](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/awesome-list-of-657-r-color-names/){: target="blank"} for a graphical display
  + **number** - e.g. `col=1`, or draw numbers from `colors()[1:657]`
    - all named colors can also be accessed by their index number
  + **RGB** - e.g. rgb(red, green, blue, alpha), e.g. `rgb(0,0,255)` = blue
    - amount of red, green, and blue, ranging from 0-255, plus transparency
  + **hexacecimal** - "#RRGGBB", e.g. `#0000FF` = blue
    - each pair of digits from 00-FF corresponds to the intensity of red, green, or blue
  + **HCL** - hue, chroma, luminescence - an alternative representation of color

# Palettes

**Palettes** are groups of related colors that are used together to convey or highlight different kinds of information. A good discussion on palettes (and colors more generally) may be found [**here**](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/D-1-apx-colors-intro.html){: target="blank"}.

General categories of palettes are:

+ **sequential**
  - Great for low-to-high things where one extreme is exciting and the other is boring, like (transformations of) p-values and correlations (caveat: here I'm assuming the only exciting correlations you're likely to see are positive, i.e. near 1).
+ **qualitative**
  - Great for non-ordered categorical things -- such as your typical factor, like country or continent. Note the special case "Paired" palette; example where that's useful: a non-experimental factor (e.g. type of wheat) and a binary experimental factor (e.g. untreated vs. treated).
+ **diverging**
  - Great for things that range from "extreme and negative" to "extreme and positive", going through "non extreme and boring" along the way, such as t-statistics and z-scores and signed correlations.
+ **hybrid** - combine qualitative and sequential aspects

Many different palettes are available in R for representing categorical or quantitative data. The current color palette in R can be accessed using `palette()`. The default one is not so nice, which is why it's good to know about other options!

Since a palette is simply a vector of color codes in R, you can also define your own palettes by manually specifying a vector of color codes, but there are also a lot of R color packages that provide a range of different color palettes.

# R Color Packages

Some color packages in R:

+ grDevices (Base R)
  - a built-in package that comes with a range of functions for defining palettes
  - includes rainbow, heat.colors, cm.colors
+ colorspace - hcl colors, now implemented in grDevices as `hcl.color()`
+ RColorBrewer - provides nice set of palettes for different display purposes
  - after installing, palettes can be accessed using `display.brewer.all()`
+ viridis - robust color scales for colorblindness
+ ggsci - scientific journal color palettes
+ unikn - color schemes of the University of Konstanz (used in the Neth book below)
+ wesanderson - 16 palettes from Wes Anderson movies (!)

# Color Blindness

[Color blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness) is the decreased ability to see differences in color. It affects many people, and red-green blindness is the most widespread form. To make sure that your graphs are as widely accessible as possible (one of your reviewers may be color-blind, too), there are two things you can do:

1. Choose colors that can be distinguished by the majority of color-blind people.
2. Use other ways to make data points visually distinct - e.g. point shape, point size, add text labels or arrows pointing at important elements.

When choosing colors that are friendly to color-blind people, you may do one of the following (arranged from lowest to largest amount of effort required):

* Whenever possible, simply avoid using red and green together.
* Try using different shades of different colors. For example, light green and dark red can be better distinguished than green and red of the same shade.
* Stick to one favorite color palette that you know works well for the color-blind and always use it. For example, you could use `viridis` (see above) for continuous data or [this palette developed by Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/) for categorical data.

* Simulate color blindness and keep adjusting the colors you use until they can be distinguished in simulated plots. [colorblindr](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) is an example of a package that can very easily simulate how ggplot2 plots look for color-blind people. The code would be as simple as this:
```
library(ggplot2)
library(colorblindr)

# create a ggplot
fig <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
# generate four basic color-vision-deficiency simulations for the ggplot
cvd_grid(fig)
```
