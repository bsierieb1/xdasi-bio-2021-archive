# Introduction

R is very powerful for creating beautiful publication-ready graphs of all kinds. Most people use one of two packages to plot data: base R or `ggplot2`.

Briefly, **Base R graphics** are great for **exploratory data analysis** because the code is quicker to write and allows "quick and dirty" plots that help you get a feel for your data. However, controlling the look and feel of base R graphs, and generating more complex graphs and figures, is somewhat cumbersome.

On the other hand, **ggplot2** is better adapted to **scientific communication** - it is more powerful, produces more visually appealing plots, and has many extensions that enable sophisticated graphical presentations. As a result, most people now use this package for much of their data analysis, and for producing publication quality graphs.

We will cover the basics of both packages in this course, but please also refer to the excellent [***R Graphics Cookbook***](https://r-graphics.org/index.html) for detailed guidance on how to visualize data in R (and tons of examples).

Here we provide a framework for thinking about graphics in general, an introduction to plotting with both packages, and links to a variety of other useful resources. We will follow these up with a lot of exercises to get you up to speed with making all kinds of plots in R.
