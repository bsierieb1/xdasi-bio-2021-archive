# What is tidy data?

Proper organization of data is absolutely essential to make downstream analyses straightforward, reproducible, or even possible. 

Read about tidy data organization in [the corresponding section on this website](https://kriscgun.github.io/xdasi-bio-2021/best_practices/tidy_data.html) and [chapter 12 of "R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html){: target="blank"}.
